- after Pt deposition -> landing posts.
H: we have to manually click to selkect the poles.
Is it possible to use image cross correllation to select the posts?
8 posts, holes with number-indicator
(mag x80, HFW 2.59 mm)

images of posts saved: D:\Heidi\HS autolamella1 (check from cross correlation to identify the centre etc)

after needle image taking : ion_flat position, take SEM, cross correlate with the image from when
saving the coordinates [IMPLEMENT, save images, store, associate]

after trench milling, rotate to electron_flat, image shifted to Jcut [correlate to adjust the coordinate]

after trench milling, rotate to electron_flat for Jcut -> cross-correlate to correct the shift

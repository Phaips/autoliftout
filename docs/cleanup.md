# Cleanup

## Thin Lamella
Once all liftouts have been comlpleted, the final stage is cleanup. This involves thinning all lamella samples to an appropriate thickness for further imaging. The centre and size of each lamella is detected and a thinning pattern is calculated. These thinning parameters can be altered in the protocol.yml file.

After the pattern is calculate, each lamella is thinned using an iterative milling pattern as shown below:

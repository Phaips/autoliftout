Cryo-liftout procedure
======================

1. Identify target region in the sample.
2. Cut lamella with two cleaning cross-sections, as usual.
3. Ensure eucentricity.
4. Position sample so it is flat to the SEM beam. (Rotate 180 degrees, tilt=pre-tilt)
5. Ensure eucentricity again.
6. Calibration of needle.
7. Insert needle.
8. Touch needle to lamella.
(Move needle tip up using ion beam view, move needle tip in x/y using electron beam view.)
9. Sputter platinum to weld lamella to the needle tip.
10. J-cut first step: cut both sides of lamella.
11. Tilt sample? J-cut second step: cut bottom of lamella.
12. Retract needle (now with atttached lamella).
13. Move to second grid.
14. Position second grid angle as appropriate.
15. Identify target location.
16. Make sure target location is straight (or mill the edge straight if you have to).
17. Center the spot where you want to attach the lamella.
18. Ensure eucentricity again.
19. Move needle in so the lamella is almost touching.
20. Sputter platinum to weld lamella to the target platform.
21. Chop off end of the needle with the ion beam.
Done.

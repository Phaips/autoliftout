eucentric

centre eb
move vertical in ib
center eb
repeat
tilt angle consideration, sin angle consideration
centre eb, move z 
cross correlate images



centre on feature in eb
start at 900hfw
    take reference images
    align ib to eb
    move z (ib distance) (accounting for tilt angles etc)
    retake eb image
    align new eb to ref (move eb back to centre) (y-movement)
repeat while outside tolerance (until movement falls below threshold, then exit or reduce hfw and repeat).

vertical_hfw = ~5 * distance_from_centre (unknown until alignment)

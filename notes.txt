Differences when we get to the landing grid:
* No inserting the multichem
* When we move the needle, first move z with ion beam view, then move x & y
* No safety buffer in z (or y or x) when you stick the landing
* The curve of the landing posts is annoying, we can get around that by
milling a flat edge on the landing post when we set up the position.


MOVING THE STAGE OUT OF THE WAY SO WE CAN SEE THE NEEDLE WITH NO BACKGROUND

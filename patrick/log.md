- remove unused functions
- add function to take and save images in 1 line
- refactor out old / new functions
- convert to object oriented design
- make sure that each shift calculation is consistent in direction so that dont need to keep swapping negative signs
- consider refactoring the calculation so it is always to - from (or similiar)
- rethink whether taking images should be done inside functions or outside and passed in

- refactor sharpen_needle
- code the cleanup stage

- replace / refactor all instances of taking and saving images
- rename calculate distance functions to be more logical
